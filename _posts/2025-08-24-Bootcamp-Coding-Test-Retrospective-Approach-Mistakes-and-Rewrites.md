I recently took an online coding assessment as part of a bootcamp application.  
It ran between the 22nd and 24th via a link shared by email.

The test consisted of:
- Two Python problems
- One SQL query
- One Database modeling question

While I can’t disclose the exact problems, I want to reflect on how I approached the test—what I did wrong, and what I can learn from it.

### 1. Working Under Time Pressure

Ultimately, I realized I need to **expose myself more to timed environments** like this.  
There was a moment when I realized my entire logic was flawed, and my mind just went blank.

I panicked. I didn’t know what to fix first, and that’s when I saw that I lacked the right debugging mindset.

> When a test case fails, I should start by carefully comparing the expected vs actual outputs.

### 2. Rushing Into Code

This is a classic trap: I skimmed the problem and jumped right into writing code.

It reminded me of students who skim a passage on a standardized test and assume they understood it. I made the same mistake.  
Even though I tried to break the problem into smaller TODOs, none of that helped when I misunderstood the core problem itself.

- I treated a 2D array as a 1D list.
- I didn’t simulate the sample inputs in my head.
- I misunderstood constraints like list lengths, assuming they were flat instead of nested.

### 3. Misinterpreting Conditional Logic

Some problems had layered conditions.  
I failed to understand their **priority or nesting structure**.

Was it an AND? An OR? A subset condition?

Turns out, one condition was embedded within another, and I was handling them in the wrong order.

### 4. SQL and Database: Getting Tougher

I felt the SQL and database questions were harder than those from the previous cohorts.  
Last time, I was able to solve both within 30 minutes—but this time, they took much longer.

Maybe the difficulty increased, or maybe I’m just rusty.

Either way, if I say I want to be a data engineer, then **weak SQL skills are like going to battle without a weapon.**

I plan to study SQL more seriously from now on—via:
- Programmers SQL practice sets and online courses 
- The book “SQL 200 Problems”

## Final Thoughts

I don’t know yet whether I passed.  
But, I’m grateful for the experience because it exposed the gaps in my process.

This test wasn’t just about coding—it reminded me of how important it is to think clearly under pressure, understand problem requirements, and write robust, testable code.

I’ll keep learning, and next time, I’ll be more ready.
