I've been working on projects, and I often feel stuck and that things are getting messy. This experience made me realize I need to deepen my knowledge in data engineering. 

After some research, I found a great resource: de101.startdataengineering.com, which combines theory with hands-on practice. I've decided to start right away.

### My goals for this learning journey are as follows:

> 1. To be able to choose the most optimal technology for a given objective.
> 2. To understand why each technology is necessary and be able to analyze their pros and cons. (This will help me make informed trade-off decisions.)
> 3. To strengthen my fundamentals to develop strong computational thinking skills.

I believe these are not just goals for this course but are the fundamental objectives of anyone studying data engineering.

A critical rule for this journey is  **to avoid relying on LLMs** for problem-solving. Recently, I've noticed I've become too dependent on them. 
I believe it's essential to build my foundational "muscles" by tackling complex and tedious problems on my own. Just as you need a strong base to lift heavy weights, I need to focus on building a solid foundation

I've already forked the repository and completed the prerequisites. I'm excited to start the practical exercises using Docker, Spark, and Airflow. 

As I continue to learn, I hope to not only become proficient in specific technologies but also to be a person who can see the big picture.
