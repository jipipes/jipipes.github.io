After submitting the coding test on the 24th, I received an email on the 25th. The phone interview was scheduled for the 26th. As with previous cohorts, I wasn’t given a choice in scheduling—it was set for me.

I had prepared for this interview in a previous cohort, so I thought I’d be fine reusing that prep. 
I actually made it to the interview stage last time, but I ultimately withdrew my application because I realized it would be impossible to balance the program with my schoolwork. 
This time, my circumstances are different, so I'm fully committed to joining. 

The call came around 3 PM and lasted about 7 minutes.

Looking back now, the only conclusion I can draw is this:
**I’m still very lacking when it comes to interviews.**

Even though I tried not to be nervous, I stumbled a lot, especially at the end of each answer. 
I must’ve come across as someone with very little confidence.

~~(At one point, I caught myself just saying "yes, yes, yes" like a customer service rep... yeah, I need to fix that.)~~

Strangely, this never happens in part-time job interviews. 
But in school-related interviews or extracurricular activities, I always freeze up. 
To improve, I think I need:

- More real interview experience

- To record and listen to my own answers

- To receive feedback on my interview delivery

### What I Was Asked
**1. Can you commit to the program schedule?**

- Have you participated in KDT before?

- Do you have a physical Naeil Baeum (K-Digital) card?

- Can you commit to full-time & core hours?

These were straightforward.

**2. Why are you interested in data engineering?**

I answered with a personal story:

I was originally a student in International Economics & Law. 
While preparing for the CPA exam, I noticed that many accounting firms preferred candidates who knew Python. That intrigued me, and I attended a talk on data analytics in accounting firms. It opened my eyes to the world of data—and I thought it was a good fit for me.

But in reality, I gave a very disorganized version of this answer. I rambled, and it must’ve been hard to follow. The interviewer even had to ask what my major was again.

I had prepared my answer to "Why this bootcamp?"—not "Why data engineering?"
The first story that came to mind was this one, but it didn’t align with what I’d written in my application (where I mentioned working at a startup as the trigger).

I should’ve:

- Started with the point, then added context (top-down)

- Structured my story better for clarity

**3. What do you hope to gain from this bootcamp?**

I answered honestly:

I don’t often get the chance to discuss ideas or share thoughts with others about DE. 
I want to talk freely with mentors and peers who are also aiming for careers in this field.

**4. You mentioned you're working on a project—what challenges are you facing?**

This one caught me off guard.
It was in my application, so I should've expected the question. But I hadn’t thought about how to answer it.

I don’t even remember what I said. I gave a vague, surface-level answer like,

“I was using the cloud but didn’t understand it well, so I paused the project to study more.”

It was a terrible answer.
There were so many great things I could have said—like how API automation was tricky, or how building a data architecture was challenging.
But I panicked and ended up sounding like I hadn't even done the project at all.
This was the worst moment of the interview for me.

**5. If you face similar challenges during the bootcamp, how would you handle them?**

I mentioned the mentoring program and said I’d actively ask mentors and teammates for help. This was a spontaneous but honest answer.

---

**6. How would you deal with skill differences during team projects?**

I said differences in skills or opinions are inevitable, so it’s important to communicate openly and use tools like Notion to make collaboration smoother.
This was a question I’d anticipated, so I answered it confidently.

---

**7. Any final words?**

They asked if I had anything to add.
I hesitated briefly, then shared a prepared statement about how determined I was. 
But I probably rambled too long—so it lacked impact.
Still, I believe in making a final impression, even if it’s just one line.

Next time, I want to prepare something short and memorable instead of a long-winded “I’ll try my best” kind of speech.

**Final Reflection**

This interview reminded me of a critical lesson:

| **“Feeling prepared” is a dangerous illusion.**

Confidence doesn’t come from thinking you’re ready.
It comes from actually preparing thoroughly, down to the last detail.
Until I reach that point, I’ll keep practicing and improving.
