title: "Soft Skill Actions: Working with a 'Efficiency-Driven' Leader."

This week, our first official project team was formed in the bootcamp.

The project hasn’t started yet, but I already ran into something worth thinking about—not a team conflict, but a **personal challenge** I feel the need to work through.

| **How do I work well with a team leader who prioritizes efficiency over discussion?**


Our current team leader has a style that leans toward quick decision-making and minimal discussion. Rather than gathering everyone's input, they tend to push tasks forward swiftly and with little room for debate.

At first, I actively engaged, answering questions and offering thoughts. But when my suggestions were dismissed without acknowledgment, I stopped speaking up at once. Interestingly, no one seemed to mind. I realized it wasn’t just me—this leader seems to push ahead unless others fully agree with their direction.

It felt like they were saying: *“I’ve already figured it all out. Do you really want to oppose it?”*

Through this, I realized that I value environments where collaboration takes priority—even if it means things take a little longer. I appreciate when everyone feels safe to voice their ideas.

So the question became:

| **What attitude should I take as a team member in this situation?**


This is just a short-term project and not the time to force a total culture shift. I also believe that if I wanted to set the tone or lead differently, I should have stepped up as team lead. Since I didn’t, I feel a responsibility to follow the current leader’s direction

That said, I’ve decided not to stay silent. If my ideas are passed over again, I plan to re-communicate them clearly and constructively.

Whether it’s in future team projects or a full-time job, I know I’ll be working with all kinds of people. Some I’ll naturally click with; others will challenge me. If this were a one-year job and not just a two-week sprint, how would I handle it?

That’s the real question I’m reflecting on.

## My Approach Going Forward

Here are some guiding principles I want to carry into any team environment, especially ones that feel challenging.

### 1. Observe and Understand

Instead of reacting emotionally, I want to approach people like I would a complex system: observe and understand.

- **Work style**: What kind of environment do they thrive in?
- **Communication style**: What communication method works best for them? How do they best process and respond to information?
- **Core motivations**: what do they value most? Is it personal achievement, team goals, stable processes, or tackling new challenges?

If I think of it like building a “user manual” for each person I work with, I can interact more effectively.

### 2. Set Healthy Boundaries

Instead of trying to be a “nice person”, focus on being a “professional colleague”. Boundaries are important for mutual respect.

- **Clarify roles** and responsibilities early on.
- Maintain **professional tone**, even if things get uncomfortable.
- **Don’t take things personally**. If someone ignores my input, it doesn’t mean they’re attacking me.

> “They’re not being difficult to upset me—they just operate differently.”

### 3. Communicate Constructively

Conflict is inevitable, especially when you work with someone long-term. But how we handle it makes all the difference.

- Use **“I” messages**, not “you” accusations.
    
    e.g. “I felt unheard during our last meeting” instead of “You ignored me.”
    
- **Stick to facts**, not assumptions.
    
    e.g. “Three of my suggestions weren’t discussed last time” is better than “You’re too controlling.”
    
- **Offer solutions**, not just complaints.
    
    e.g. “Would it be possible to allocate 30 minutes for idea-sharing next time?”

By actively practicing this mindset, I hope to build my soft skills along with my technical ones. If I want to work in a global, cross-functional environment—especially abroad—then this is just as important as coding.

I’m still learning, but this experience is already helping me grow in ways I didn’t expect.
