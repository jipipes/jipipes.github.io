Recently a question was asked in a data engineer group chat:

| **Do data engineers have to take coding tests?**

While it's a common question from beginners, it made me stop and think.

> Why do companies require them? 
> Is it just to screen for the best candidates among a flood of applicants?

After some reflection, I came to a different conclusion.

I believe they want to see if you have the **minimum level of problem-solving skills** needed for the job.

The test isn't meant to determine if someone is a "good developer" based on their score. Instead, it serves as a gateway to confirm that a candidate possesses the foundational skills to move on to the next interview stage.

Since problem-solving is especially critical for a data engineer. I believe coding tests are a crucial and meaningful part of the hiring process.

### Coding Test ≠ Competitive Programming

A coding test isn’t about proving you're a genius.

It’s about showing that:

1. You can **analyze a problem**
2. And **implement a solution** in code

This includes:

- Understanding constraints
- Coming up with a viable approach
- Writing syntactically and logically correct code
- Doing all of this under **time pressure**

### Coding Interview vs Coding Test

While a coding test is about performance under pressure, a coding interview adds another layer:

> Can you explain your thinking clearly and logically?


You may be asked to:

- Code live in front of an interviewer(or together with eidit mode)
    - Walk through your logic
- Sketch out architectures on a whiteboard
    - Discuss trade-offs and alternatives

This interview both your **technical clarity** and **communication skills** — two must-haves for real-world software development.

### What types of questions do coding tests include?

1. **Implementation Problems**

> Logic is already provided. You just need to code it up.

These are usually entry-level and assess basic programming fluency. Think of them as warm-up questions.

2. **Algorithm Comprehension**

> You're expected to design an efficient algorithm to solve the give problem.

Not just "Can you solve it?" but:

- Can you solve it **well** (effectively)?
- Can you solve it **fast** (efficiently)?

Here, understanding **Big-O complexity** becomes essential.

3. **Competency-Level Challenges**

> Requires knowledge of specific data structures and advanced algorithms.

These are more difficult and are often used in competitions or final-round interviews. Examples:

- BFS / DFS
- Dijkstra
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Traversals

4. **SQL / Domain-Specific Tests**

> ex. Can you write a vaild SQL query under constraints?

Often used for data-related roles or positions with domain-specific tooling.

### TL;DR

Coding tests are about:

- Assessing whether applicant have **the minimum level** of problem-solving skills.
